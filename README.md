# What is Tech Radar

Tech Radar is a tool or framework used to map, evaluate, and categorize technologies based on their maturity and relevance in software development. The Tech Radar is divided into "rings," which indicate the adoption stage of the technology, ranging from exploration, evaluation, to adoption or avoid.
We use four rings with the following semantics:

* **ADOPT**  — Technologies we have high confidence in to serve our purpose, also in large scale. Technologies with a usage culture in our production environment, low risk and recommended to be widely used.

* **TRIAL** — Technologies that we have seen work with success in project work to solve a real problem; first serious usage experience that confirm benefits and can uncover limitations. TRIAL technologies are slightly more risky; some engineers in our organization walked this path and will share knowledge and experiences.

* **ASSESS** — Technologies that are promising and have clear potential value-add for us; technologies worth to invest some research and prototyping efforts in to see if it has impact. ASSESS technologies have higher risks; they are often brand new and highly unproven in our organisation. You will find some engineers that have knowledge in the technology and promote it, you may even find teams that have started a prototyping effort.

* **HOLD** — Technologies not recommended to be used for new projects. Technologies that we think are not (yet) worth to (further) invest in. HOLD technologies should not be used for new projects, but usually can be continued for existing projects.

# What is the purpose?

The purpose of the Tech Radar is to help teams and organizations make better technology decisions by providing insights into the latest trends and technologies, while offering guidance on adopting technologies that best suit their needs. It is an evolving approach for assessing technologies and best practices in the software development world.
